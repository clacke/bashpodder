This is my personal branch of `bashpodder`.

The `upstream` branch contains the untainted original from
[http://lincgeek.org/bashpodder/](http://lincgeek.org/bashpodder/) and the `master` branch
is the one I use on my computers.

The `bashpodder` home page says this is licensed under "the GPL", but doesn't
specify closer.
It links to [https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html), which I
interpret as saying that this is "GPL v3 or later", as the link
currently shows the GPL v3 and will presumably be updated when
the license is updated.
